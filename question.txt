Coding Task 01: Implement forward and backpropagation for Figure 01 Neural Network. Use ReLU in the hidden layer and sigmoid in the output layer as an activation function. (Using Figure 01)

Mathematical Task 01: Write all mathematical equations in each layer. (Using Figure 01)

Mathematical Task 02: Calculate layer to layer parameter(matrix size) calculation & no of operation( multiplication & addition) needed for below neural network. (Using Figure 02)

Theory 01: What is transfer learning? Explain how transfer learning is used in image classification.

Theory 02: What is the loss function and why do we use it (include some names of loss function)?

Theory 03: What is Cross validation? Why do we need this?
